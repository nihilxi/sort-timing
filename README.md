# Sorting Algorithm Performance Comparison in C++

## Overview
This C++ program aims to compare the runtime performance of the 5 most popular sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort. The goal is to provide insights into their efficiency under different scenarios.

## Algorithms Included
1. **Bubble Sort:** Simple and intuitive, but less efficient for large datasets.
2. **Selection Sort:** Straightforward with a time complexity of O(n^2).
3. **Insertion Sort:** Suitable for small datasets, with a time complexity of O(n^2).
4. **Merge Sort:** Efficient for large datasets, with a time complexity of O(n log n).
5. **Quick Sort:** One of the fastest algorithms with average-case time complexity O(n log n).

## How to Run
To execute the comparison, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in your preferred C++ development environment.
3. Compile the program using the provided source code.
4. Run the executable, and input the desired dataset size.

## Output
The program generates a detailed report showcasing the execution time of each sorting algorithm for the specified dataset size. This allows users to make informed decisions based on algorithm performance characteristics.

## Notes
- Adjust the dataset size for a more comprehensive analysis.
- Consider tweaking the code to measure memory usage or other relevant metrics.
